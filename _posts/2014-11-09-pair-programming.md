I was remote pairing with a co-worker and we used [nitrious.io](). It worked well, but noticed that I was copying the files locally to run them. While the script will run on that server, I needed to connect to a server inside my firewall.

Ok, so here is what I found out:

Great article on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8028358/real-time-tool-for-collaborative-coding), that was marked as unproductive, gave tons of links.

- First thing I'm going to try out is [floobits](https://floobits.com/) that is integrated into sublime.
- [Codiad](http://codiad.com/) looked like a great opensource (php) web based project. Very cool. For some reason wish it were js based like Etherpad, but it is probably just as good.
- [Firepad](http://www.firepad.io/) looks like great leverage of [Firebase](). It is what is behind nitrious. Which again, is stellar. Firebase sure is cool, with so many great examples out in the wild. But it is a little rich for me. Will go through articles like the one on [quora](http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-closest-open-source-alternative-to-Firebase) to find out other possible opensource synchronization frameworks.
