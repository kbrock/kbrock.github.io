There are a number of tools to choose from that are taking a non-linear approach to a slide presentation

For me this does not mean that the page swirls around (prezi), but rather there is more than one "next slide" available. A number of tools are laying out slides in a grid. I'm using [reveal][], although  [bespoke][] and [flowtime][] would probably work just as well.

[reveal]: http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/
[bespoke]: http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js/
[flowtime]: https://github.com/marcolago/flowtime.js/

I've noticed that most presentations in reveal tend to not know what to do with the 2 dimensions, mostly using down and right just to mix things up. They might as well just have used powerpoint with different transitions.

For my presentaions, I want to use down to drill into an idea and right to go on to the next idea. Curious how this will play out.
