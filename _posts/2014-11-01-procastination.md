I want to share my ideas, but it is tricky to organize a presentation:

- Message
    + Think of a topic
    + Organize thoughts
    + Cater to the audience.
- Write it down
    + Markdown is easy to read/write by has limited metadata support.
    + Just too many software packages to choose from.
- Style
    + Leverage existing themes

But my style just doesn't fit into the typical presentation software.
So I tend to try and write software to help me organize my thoughts.

But presentation software is difficult, and I never finish the software.
And I never finish the story. And I never add any style.

So I'm a procastinator - right?
Writing software so I can avoid writing down the message?

Maybe not.

One thing is for certain, I need something other than a linear tool for presentations.

In the mean time, I'll write down my thoughts with [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) in [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
