I always want to give a presentation. So I setup technology to make it easier.
I never get around to the actual content.

But then I realized that the technology is what I wanted to speak about.
So ignore what I'm saying and ask yourself how I'm saying it.

I managed to squeeze into here:

- [Common Mark](http://commonmark.org/) (Artist formerly known as markdown) via [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/)
- [pygments.rb](https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb) to display source code.
- [revealjs](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) for the presentation software
- [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) did most of the work for me.
