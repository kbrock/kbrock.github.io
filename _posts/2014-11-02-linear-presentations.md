There are a number of tools to choose from that are taking a non-linear approach to take this into account.

For me this does not necessarily mean that the page swirls around (prezi), but rather there are a number of next-slides available. Starting to use [revealjs](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). (althought bespoke also looked like a great choice.)

I've noticed that most presentations in reveal tend to not know what to do with the 2 dimensions, mostly using down and right just to mix things up. They might as well just have used powerpoint with different transitions.

For my presentaions, I want to use right to move on to the next idea, while leveraging down to drill down into the concepts behind the idea

Have added a presentation layout to jekyll, removed the markdown and code hilighting, but still have a lot of work for the themes. Luckily both use sass, so merging the variables shouldn't be too hard.
