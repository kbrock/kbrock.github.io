This is a test post to verify styling. It will be removed before launch.

## Code Example

Here's some Ruby code with syntax highlighting:

```ruby
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greet("World")
```

And some Swift:

```swift
func greet(_ name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

greet("World")
```

## Typography Test

This paragraph tests the vertical rhythm and line height. Good typography has consistent spacing that creates a pleasant reading experience. The text should feel balanced and easy to scan.

> This is a blockquote. It should have a steel blue left border and stand out from the body text while remaining readable.

### Inline Code

You can use `inline code` within paragraphs. It should have a subtle background.

### Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with `code`

1. Numbered one
2. Numbered two
3. Numbered three
