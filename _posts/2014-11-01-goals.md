I have an idea for a new way to create a presentation.
But the idea is too big for me to wrap my mind around.

My friends seem to like the idea, they all ask, "Can you pull it off?"

Right now? No.
I do not yet have a process to collect and organize my thoughts around this presentations.

So there you have it. This blog is the collection of thought that I am developing around telling a story.

My Goals are to produce a few deliverables:

- A workflow for moving ideas from concept to a presentation.
- A post to describe each of the workflow steps.
- A list of tools for each of the workflow steps.
- A classification scheme to group posts together.
- Tools for expressing ideas (e.g. graphs, powerpoints, pros)
- Presentations
