My mac was running a little slow.

I first went the anti-virus route. But they end up installing so much infrastructure and tons of programs to check and protect from viruses that they just slowed down my computer even more.

Stumbled across [the safe mae](http://www.thesafemac.com//mmg/) which turned out to be a wonderful resource.

On my son's computer [adware medic](http://www.adwaremedic.com/) removed a bunch of javascript files that were modifying his homepage and others.

On my computer, I used [EtreCheck](http://etresoft.com/etrecheck) for general diagnosis.
Also installed Loadables from the app store to help me uninstall programs that were running. Turns out my son had a bunch of drivers from old projects that we were no longer running.

Outcome? His 4GB 6yr old computer is running like a race horse. So much cool software out there.
