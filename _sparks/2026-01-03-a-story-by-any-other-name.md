A story starts with a setting, adds events to get the character to a conclusion. It is hopefully something that the audience can relate with the beginning, how the events change the subject, and how the outcome is released.

Seems an essay, thesis, song, email, presentation, meeting, and others are kinda the same. You want to audience to start at the same spot, and the hear the actions and how they get to a conclusion.

A request for help is a person presenting the starting point and the desired outcome, and asking what changes can be introduced to get there.

Feel like they all have a story arc. Though many people would take offense by me calling an accedemic paper a story, but they are trying to have the reader follow your journey proving your point.
