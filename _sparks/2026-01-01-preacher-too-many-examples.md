## Inspiration

Sometimes in church growing up, the preacher had a narrative and they shared a blurb from the bible. Then they would share an anecdote (parallel example) from their life, like their parishioner or child doing something funny. Unfortunately, sometimes the preacher would include 5+ examples that were the same story in different skin. It was way too much.

## Observation

After I speak with someone, if I include all my examples, it overwhelms them.

## Reaction

Wish I could give some note to the preacher that I like stories about dogs (not a cat person) so they could tailor the message.

Think a blog post where it would allow the user to select cats > dogs or dogs > cats, and the same high level presentation swaps the characters or anecdotes.

Also think a presentation where the people would be able to vote: I want to hear about X, and the presentation changes in real time. The audience following along could say: too far in the weeds or more detail too. Or there could be a counter showing what page they are on, so you could judge if you are going too fast/slow and tailor accordingly.

## Technical

Probably just some javascript showing and hiding divs based upon the audience's choice.

Ask the user for their background, and present the story differently based upon that statement. e.g. do you think in terms of technology or business goal? Do you know ruby or java or sql. It includes different examples or reformatted example based upon the audience's choice.
