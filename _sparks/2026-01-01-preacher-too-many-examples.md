Growing up, the preacher had a sermon and it started with a message from the Bible and an anecdote from their life or a popular book. It was nice to get an example. But often he would continued to share anecdote after anecdote, often hitting 5+ examples.

I get that they want to share a store that each person can relate to, but more often than not, it just zoned people out. Wish there was a way to share politely, "You've made your point. The horse is dead."
