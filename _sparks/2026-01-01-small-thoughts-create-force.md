I sometimes have big thoughts and sometimes small thoughts. So I teeter between a micro blog with mini articles (4 lines) and a full fledged blog.

Well, I probably always have small thoughts, but then I want to generalize these thoughts so I end up bringing the small entries together. I do have themes across these topics.

I feel the micro articles, we can probably call them inspiration or problems or observations, end up creating a force, and from there I want to generalize into a longer theme.

## Technical conclusion

Create sparks (small thoughts) and have those feed posts. The sparks are the raw capture, the posts are the linearized output. Don't force the small thoughts to be posts. Let them be small. The force they create will eventually produce the larger story.
