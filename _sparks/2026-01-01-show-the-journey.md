I like to see the journey, see the decisions along the way, and then come up with understandings how we did well and not well and tweak how I interpret.

Meta: this is why I asked Claude to keep a running log of our conversation. I want to see how conclusions are reached, not just the conclusions.

But of course this works much better for me if the person front loads the summary/takeaways. Because sometimes I don't need to know how they came to that conclusion. I possibly have already come to that conclusion and unless I need backing to feel more secure with my view (which is possible) I often want to skip that and move on to something else we can discover together.

It is tricky though, some people (including me) need to feel understood, so cutting them off from explaining their rationale is rude and makes them feel not heard. When in truth I want to say "I totally agree. I have come to the same conclusion and you are smart. You're preaching to the choir." But they sometimes hear "I don't care about your discovery" or "that discovery was trivial" or "I don't care about you".
