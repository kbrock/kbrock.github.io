If I wait for every idea to be fully formed, I'll never publish anything. Perfectionism is the enemy of progress.

Sparks exist to capture thoughts in motion. A spark might become a post, or connect to other sparks, or stay a seed. That's fine. The alternative - endless editing of the same document - means nothing ships.

I'd rather have many small thoughts that build over time than one perfect essay that never exists.
