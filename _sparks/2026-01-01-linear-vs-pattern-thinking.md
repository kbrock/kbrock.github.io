My brain sees interconnected patterns. Others need linear sequences. Neurodivergent thinking isn't wrong, it's unlinearized.

I'm not linear. So sometimes I have an example and don't know the problem/theme or have a hypothesis.

Sometimes it is impossible to follow just what the other person was thinking, or how they got to the conclusion. And that is ok. As long as you see the inputs and see the outputs and they feel sound.

But it sometimes does leave an uncomfortable feeling. Because sometimes people use misdirection in the middle. Like how in math you can prove 1=2 because in the middle you use a division by 0.

So you are sometimes stuck if the other person thinks non-linearly/pattern match and you think linearly. We both like to say "I think logically" and that suggests that you have a -> b -> c. But it doesn't always work that way.

We are throwing these thoughts into an AI neural net. That is not a linear program, but rather a neurodivergent system. And we are content with that.
