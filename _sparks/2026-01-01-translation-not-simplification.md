When I share from the problem perspective, people get confused and distracted and can't follow. So I need to translate this into more linear thoughts.

A story is not laid out in the same manner that the inspiration/problems strike.

I've spent time trying to understand story structure so I can do this conversion. Think a bunch of psychologists are probably studying and writing about this right now. Or maybe they aren't thinking this way. Or maybe they are but can't express it either.

This is basically trying to come up with a system for a neurodivergent thinker to convert the thoughts into a system that typicals understand.
