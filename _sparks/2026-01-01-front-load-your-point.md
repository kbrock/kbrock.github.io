In a position paper, aka wedge essay, aka Churchill essay, it states a thesis, backup details, and the thesis again. The purpose of the essay is reiterated.

Sure would be nice if emails, meeting requests, presentations, and other communication did the same.
Meetings with a proper title and agenda tends to run more smoothly. The goals tend to be accomplished when they are stated, and the attendees can come prepared.

I find it frustrating when 20 recipients of the email have to spend time summarizing because the 1 author didn't do it properly. Also, it is easier for recipients to act upon the email when the email states the desired action.
