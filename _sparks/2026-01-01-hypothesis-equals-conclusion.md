A hypothesis is a conclusion with different rhetorical position.

- Hypothesis: "Here's what I think. Let me show you why."
- Conclusion: "Here's what I showed you. Therefore this."

The content is identical, the framing changes.

There are many names for hypothesis: conclusion, thesis, summary, take away, subject, the point.
Some are larger than others and some are more flushed out. But they are the take away no matter how you phrase it.

A story doesn't have to share the conclusion up front (the last page), but often if the author actively acknowledges the last page to themself, when going back and editing, then the story reads better.
Or if nothing else, write down what you wanted the person to get out of it, and then "edit" it trying to ensure that the user gets what you wanted them to get.

Chances are, that statement is your hypothesis/conclusion. In a romance story, it is not "guy gets girl," but rather "guy who works hard gets what he wants" or "girl is always in control" or...
