When I set the stage for a story, I rely upon other people's preconceptions and experiences to help me set the stage. Movies do it with the title (Terminator 2), well known actor (Arnold), or trope.

Now if a person hasn't watched Terminator 1, they their preconceptions coming in are different, and it will change the way they interpret the events of story. They could have grown up in a place that is more violent or more flowers or always rainy.

What they bring into the room changes how they hear the story
