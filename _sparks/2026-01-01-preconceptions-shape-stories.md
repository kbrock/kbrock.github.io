When I tell you a story, you are bringing your preconceived notions and experiences into it and will hear a different story than someone else who hears the same story.

A hypothesis is just a statement "if we start in this place and follow these facts, I'm guessing we will end up at this place".
And the scientific method has us test with a couple of different characters and starting points and sees if we get to the same conclusion.

You can call it prejudice, experience, common sense, starting point, skill, background. It is what the reader brings. And it affects how they hear your story.

Sometimes when you are sharing, you don't have a conclusion.
Instead you present the story arc and want the the other person use their skills/preconceptions to help you figure out where your steps went wrong.
You lay out the inputs, show them your process, and invite them to find the flaw.
Their different perspective might catch what you missed or come to a different conclusion..
