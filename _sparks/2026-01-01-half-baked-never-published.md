I don't feel I can publish thoughts because they are half baked. Once I work them into more, they could be published, but I would want to tweak in the future. So they never end. I am stuck in edit mode.

I also want to not have a document that is constantly evolving. I would like to be able to take my thoughts and create a story/post/presentation with a hypothesis and finish it. Then I learn more, find another pattern and add to the post count rather than constantly tweaking the same article.

If you want to tweak the same article, that works when it is in a theme. People see the progression and feel like they are following a linear/typical person's thoughts.

Some of these thoughts are half baked, some bring a bunch together.

Problems:
- They are too short to be a blog post
- I can make these thoughts linear, and tease apart the threads, but what do I do with it
- Some of these thoughts are half baked, some bring a bunch together
