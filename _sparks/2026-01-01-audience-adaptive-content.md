## Hypothesis (Claude-authored)

Content should adapt to the audience's declared context, not assume one-size-fits-all.

## Ideas

- Same content, different presentation based on reader's background
- Reader declares: "I think in tech" vs "I think in business"
- Examples swap (ruby vs java vs sql)
- Anecdotes swap (dogs vs cats)
- Live presentations could take votes
- Pacing could adapt to audience feedback

## Possible stories this could inform

- "Why I show my work" - thesis: Conclusions without reasoning are untrustworthy
- "The translation problem" - thesis: Neurodivergent thinking isn't wrong, it's unlinearized
- "Small thoughts, big patterns" - thesis: Micro-observations compound into frameworks
