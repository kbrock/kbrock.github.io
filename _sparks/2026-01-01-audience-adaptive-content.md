Content can adapt to the audience's declared context.

Audience members can say "I prefer business or tech" and the speaker can focus on ROI vs technology.
Or they can say "I prefer javascript or python" to see appropriate code examples.
Maybe "I like cats vs dogs" to change graphics and anecdotes.
Users could request in realtime a deep dive or a speed up.
It would be like interactive fiction, but in realtime. Would probably translate to offline handouts, as well.

Conference WiFi issues may sabotage, as telling the attendee to be distracted.
