I don't trust summaries. I like to see how people came to the conclusion. Because I'm constantly incorporating new ideas into my model of the world. I like some form of order, and work better when I can create generalized rules.

Whenever you summarize anything, you sometimes come up with the wrong conclusion. I am amused how little thoughts inspire the final result. You can go back and say "huh, a -> b. I see why I thought that but a is not an absolute truth (there are none) so my conclusions aren't quite right". And I'll revisit.
