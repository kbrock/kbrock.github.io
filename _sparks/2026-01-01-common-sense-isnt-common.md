In all conversations, you share a piece of information, and you hope the other person has the same prejudices/experiences/judgements/common sense/skills and can understand where your story starts.

Sometimes you want to then layout the details in a way that the person joins you in a journey. Other times you acknowledge that the other person has different skills coming in and will then follow a different journey with your details. They will ask questions to get better details, and come to a different finale/conclusion.

We assume others have the same experiences, dubbing it "common sense". But they don't.

You have an experience and that sets up these rules/prejudices and those change how you behave. Get burnt by fire, avoid it. See a young driver and they are sporadic, think all kids are bad drivers. Confirmation bias can reinforce that in unhelpful ways.
