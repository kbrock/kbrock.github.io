# About

I'm Keenan Brock. I collect ideas, explore tools, and sometimes solve problems.

This blog is where I work through thoughts - from half-baked concepts to working solutions. Topics include Ruby, Swift, AI, health, and whatever else I'm curious about.

## How I Write

- One concept per post
- Keep it short (1-2 pages)
- One new technology at a time

## Find Me

- [GitHub](https://github.com/kbrock)

## Icons
