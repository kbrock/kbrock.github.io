# TODO

Purpose: Active tasks and future ideas.

## Tasks for Claude

- [ ] Want take away: deep thinker, fun, but a back end person. clean up sparks. highlight/change self deprecating tones and doubt.
- [ ] problem: I want to write about ui, but doesn't seem to hit my take away. In truth it is about simplifying processes so maybe I'll use the n+1 tag and it will be good

## Tasks for Me

- [ ] Write first real post
- [ ] Test on mobile
- [ ] prune tags. I like pictures, but they are friction

### Near Term


### Presentations

- [ ] Research Asvin Goel reveal.js-plugins (Seminar, Poll for audience interaction)
- [ ] Graphviz/DOT support for diagrams

### Sparks (lower priority)

- [ ] move sublime tabs to sparks
- [ ] move iCloud/projects over to sparks or posts
- [ ] move spiral bound and apple notes into sparks

### Later

- [ ] AWS Lambda for dynamic features
- [ ] Swift app for capturing ideas? (currently using notes)
- [ ] Hand-drawn icons to replace Simple Icons
- [ ] AWS S3/CloudFront deployment option

### Maybe

- [ ] Dark mode toggle UI (CSS already supports themes, but no manual toggle yet)
- [ ] Stimulus.js for forms/interactivity
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts (client-side JS)
- [ ] Markdown icon references: `![ruby]` + `[ruby]: /assets/icon.svg#icon-ruby`
  - or maybe that is a markdown processor (like GitHub Flavored Markdown)
  - also revist code that made the presentation that replaced full with an abreviation.
- [ ] Do we want to tweak style based upon svbtle/obtvse styling?
- [ ] return to https://www.zolkos.com/2025/12/03/vanilla-css-is-all-you-need and wonder how we can leverage css
