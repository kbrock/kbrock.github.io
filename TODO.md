# TODO

Purpose: Active tasks and future ideas.

## Active

- [ ] Test on mobile
- [ ] Test with dark mode and light mode
- [ ] Write first real post

## Future Ideas

### Near Term

- [ ] Dark mode toggle UI (CSS already supports themes)
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts
- [ ] forms and Stimulus for forms/calculators

### Later

- [ ] Jekyll generator plugin for cleaner fingerprinting syntax
- [ ] Hand-drawn icons to replace Simple Icons
- [ ] AWS S3/CloudFront deployment option

### Maybe

- [ ] Presentation and post from same content
- [ ] Stimulus.js for forms/interactivity
- [ ] Liquid tags for icons: `{% icon ruby %}`, `{% tag ruby %}`
- [ ] Markdown icon references: `![ruby]` with `[ruby]: /assets/icon.svg#icon-ruby`
